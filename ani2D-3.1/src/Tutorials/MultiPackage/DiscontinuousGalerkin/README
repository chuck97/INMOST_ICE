*** Objectives ***

The program demonstrates the DG solution for the following boudary value problem (bvp):

  -div  grad u = -2  in  Omega
             u = g   on  dOmega_D

where Omega = { x^2 + y^2 < 1 } and  g = x*x

Exact solution of this problem is u=x*x. To solve this problem we use
a mixture of P2 and P3 finite element. For triangles with centers
belonging to the disk or radius 0.5, we use the quadratic finite
elements. For the remaining triangles, we use the cubic finite elements.
These elements represent the solution exactly, therefore the expected
error should be zero (see the output).

   main.f      - Main program with calls routines from the libraries

   forlibfem.f - The user-prepared file for the library libfem2D (matrix 
                 and right-hand side generators). It provides routines
                 for computing the diffusion tensor, boundary conditions 
                 and the right-hand side.

   forlibaft.c - The user-prepared file for the library libAFT2D (generation of
                 the computational mesh). It provides parameterization of the
                 curved boundary.
